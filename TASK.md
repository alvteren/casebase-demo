Chatbot very similar to ChatGPT that can do at least the following things. 

1) Can answer general questions. 

1) Let the user upload documents that get stored in a vector database so we can ask questions about them using RAG.

2) Produce a PDF document using information from the chat the user is having with the AI. 

Please build it in node.js. You can use whatever libraries, tools, or third party stuff you want.

I am evaluating you on performance, design, UX, and code quality so this is an important test!
